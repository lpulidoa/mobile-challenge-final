# Mobile automation challenge

Hello there!

This is my solution for the Mobile Automation Challenge for the Endava Internship 2023-1. 
This projects consists of 4 test cases for the IMDB app version 8.8.1.108810400. 
The option to run it on two different emulators that are installed on my machine, along with the ability to run it in the cloud via SauceLabs are included! you just need to make a very simple change in the Hooks class :3
